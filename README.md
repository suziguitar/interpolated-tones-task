# interpolated-tones-task
Diana Deutsch-style interpolated tones task

This script creates stimuli for use in a same/different interpolated tones task. 

Each trial contains one standard tone, 8 interpolated tones, and one comparison tone, where standard and comparison tones can either be the same as each other or different to each other.

Interpolated tones comprise 8 tones sampled with replacement and never contain the standard or comparison tone.
